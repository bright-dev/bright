r"""This method is responsible for adding the current material data for this pass to 
the output text and hdf5 files for this component.  Further calculations for this 
pass should not be performed after write_mat_pass() has been called.

This function has one very important subtletywhen writing *text* output. It does 
not write out material data directly. Rather, input columns are given as normalized 
isotopic vectors.  As weight fractions, input columns are in units of 
[kg_mat_feed[nuc]/kg_mat_feed.mass].  Moreover, the output columns are given in 
terms relative to the mass of the input mass, [kg_mat_prod[nuc]/kg_mat_feed.mass].  
These are calculated via the following expressions.

.. math::

    \\mbox{inpcol[nuc]} = \\mbox{mat\_feed.comp[nuc]}

    \\mbox{outcol[nuc]} = \\mbox{mat\_prod.comp[nuc]} \\times \\frac{\\mbox{mat\_prod.mass}}{\\mbox{mat\_feed.mass}}

Because of the units of these two columns, total mass flow data may often only be 
recovered via the "Mass" parameter in the parameter file.  Here is a sample 
LWRIsos.txt file for a light water reactor for the first pass::
