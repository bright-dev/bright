This is ostensibly done via the methodology detailed in Lamarsh's 
`Nuclear Reactor Theory <http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Nuclear-Reactor-Theory-Lamarsh/dp/0894480405>`_.

Unfortunately, this formulation for the disadvantage factor is **only** valid 
in the case where a << b! Often times, modern (thermal) reactors do not satisfy 
this requirement.  We instead have a 'thin moderator' situation.

To fix this problem properly requires going to a multi-region diffusion/transport 
calculation.  Doing so is beyond the scope of Bright at this time and certainly 
beyond the aspirations of a one-group methodology.  A strategy that is more 
in-line with current practice is to use the results of a more sophisticated method, 
interpolate over them, and use them here.

Thus in the case where 0.1 < VF/VC, where the fuel is greater than 10% of 
the coolant, the above strategy is what is implemented. A baseline disadvantage 
factor is determined from data presented in "*Thermal disadvantage factor 
calculation by the multi-region collision probability method*" by B. Ozgener,

account for variations in fuel composition and fluence.
